Open AI Gym Application for the LunarLander environment

I train several reinforcement learning algorithms on the LunarLander-v2 environment of Open AI Gym

There are 8 states / observations and 4 actions.

Starting with V0, where a state-action dictionary (Q-matrix) is set up to catch and update for each state the action-reward pairs.

This is work in progress..
